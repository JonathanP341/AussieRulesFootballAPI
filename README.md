This spreadsheet contains data from the 2023 and the 2024 AFL seasons. The data contained includes:
  1) Standings
  2) Power Rankings according to Squiggle
  3) Aggregate Power Rankings
  4) Playoffs with scores included and predicted favourites if not yet completed

This was coded in Google Apps Script, but as it is stored in the cloud I will just copy paste into a javascript file.
